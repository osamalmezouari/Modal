# Centered Alert with Background Overlay 

## Description

This project demonstrates an alert section displayed in the center of the page using TypeScript, HTML, and Sass. The alert section includes a dismiss button, and when activated, it appears above the page content while maintaining a semi-transparent overlay on the background.

## Features

- **Centered Alert Display:** The alert section is positioned in the center of the page for better visibility.
- **Dismiss Button:** Users can remove the alert section by clicking the dismiss button.
- **Background Overlay:** When the alert is displayed, the background remains visible with reduced opacity, providing emphasis on the alert without completely obstructing the page content.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript:** Manages the logic for showing and hiding the alert section.
- **HTML:** Provides the structure for the alert section and the page content.
- **Sass:** Stylesheets written in Sass to style the alert section and implement the background overlay effect.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**

2. **Compile Sass to CSS:**
- Use a Sass compiler to convert the Sass files to CSS. For example, using `sass` command-line tool: 
  ```
  sass input.scss output.css
  ```

3. **Open the HTML File:**
- Open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

4. **Usage:**
- Click the button to display the alert section in the center of the page.
- Observe the background with reduced opacity behind the alert section.
- Click the dismiss button to remove the alert.
